# NumberClassifier

This repository contains a custom Neural Network Algorithm based on the code proposed by Michael Nielsen in "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and the course "Machine Learning" offered by Standford and instructed by Andrew NG, this course is available in Coursera.

The MNIST dataset is used to test the algorithm. Initially, the gradient descent algorithm is implemented to train the network, future perspectives will implement different algorithms to train the network, like genetic algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms.
